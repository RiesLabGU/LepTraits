"THERE WERE ONLY THREE CODERS (All authors): Leslie Ries (LVR), Minji Ku (MK), Vaughn Shirey (VMS)",,,,,,
INITIAL RANDOM 150 RECORDS WERE CODED BY ALL THREE CODERS UNTIL CONVERGENCE ON CODES WERE ACHIEVED,,,,,,
QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS ENSURED THE THREE CODERS STAYED REASONABLY ALIGNED ON CODING DECISIONS,,,,,,
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANNOTATORS - THESE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS USED TO CODE HABITAT ON A RECORD-BY-RECORD LEVEL (SEE RECORD-LEVEL CODES TAB),,,,,,
"1. For each line in the tab ""Species Habitat Descriptors"", first see if you can find a single descriptor that captures all the different elements in the Habitat Description from Species Account (Column E)",,,,,,
,"1a. If you find an appropriate terms, copy the whole line INCLUDING THE FIELD WITH THE DESCRIPTOR - Paste into the appropriate columns in ""Species Habitat Descriptors"" (Columns F-K)",,,,,
,,"Glossary (see below) is sorted by type: NO/LOW information (often the case), Biome specific, Forest specific, Edge specific, Open specific, Combos (common combinations of two or more terms)",,,,
,,"- Note that if the description seems incomplete (cutoff suddenly) - please just use code from NO/LOW information ""Description appears incomplete"" and don't try to code anything else",,,,
,"1b. Adding ""extra"" descriptors",,,,,
,,"Any language that invokes descriptors that are relevant for codes, e.g., +WET, +DRY, +SHRUB, +TUNDRA,+HERBACEOUS, +GARDENS (+G,+Dist), +EDGE, +DISTURBED, +NATURAL",,,,
,,"- BUT ENTER THE TERM INTO THE ""EXTRA INFO"" COLUMN F",,,,
,,-THEN MODIFY CODES AS APPROPRIATE - GENERALLY JUST ADDING THAT CODE TO THE APPROPRIATE COLUMN AND NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ELSE,,,,
,"1c. If you don't find an appropriate terms, and it seems like you need to come up with an ""ad-hoc"" set of codes:",,,,,
,,"- Label the column F (Glossary term) ""Ad-hoc""",,,,
,,- come up the codes you think best capture the description of the habitat,,,,
,"1d. The meaning of ""U"". Generally, U means ""undescribed"" - but it can be combined with other descriptors (e.g., UW) if the description indicates the species likes wet habitat, but doesn't say anything about its affinity for normal or dry habitat",,,,,
,,"- If it says ""wet and dry"" - then you can indicate WD (it likes both)",,,,
,,"-BUT, if it indicates a preference for a certain habitat type (e.g., Dry) - then just use the code D",,,,
2. Information to ignore,,,,,,
,"3a. IGNORE ELEVATIONAL INFORMATION (That is consistently already captured in the original extraction, so don't worry about it!)",,,,,
,"3b. IGNORE LOCALITY AND RANGE INFORMATION (Lists of places where the species has been seen or geographical ranges (e.g., in the Southwest)",,,,,
,"3c. IGNORE MOST FLIGHT INFORMATION (e.g., rests on forest floor, flies close to canopy, flies along streams) - UNLESS it is specific to male perch and patrol behavior - put that separately into column O (Perch and patrol)",,,,,
"3. When you are done with a line, enter your initials in column M (""Annotator"")",,,,,,
,,,,,,
CODERS WERE GIVEN A GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND THEY COULD PICK OUT A SET OF CODES BASED ON A SINGLE HABITAT DESCRIPTION,,,,,,
"NO SPECIES-LEVEL TRAITS WERE BASED ON SUB-CANOPY, BUT THOSE CODES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE RECORD-LEVEL CODES TAB ",,,,,,
term,canopy,sub-canopy,ForestEdge /Gap,moisture,disturbance,Comments
No information,,,,,,
Varies substantively by region and/or sex,,,,,,In specific situation where habitat associations are described for two different regions and they VARY ENOUGH AS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE ONE TERM OVER ANOTHER!!
Description appears incomplete,,,,,,
No relevant terms,U,U,U,U,U,"Includes broad biome description (e.g., tropical, temperate) or description ""near"" something (except water or edges) - ""near trees"""
Habitat unknown,,,,,,"Only use this when the record indicates that the habitat is not known by the author (as opposed to not listing any relevant information, in that case, use ""No relevant terms"")"
Perch and/or patrol data only,,,,,,This is only to be used if the information in the habitat descriptor ONLY refers to perch or patrol (usually male) behavior - put description in column O
Stray in this region,U,U,U,U,U,
Habitat is a species comparison,,,,,,
